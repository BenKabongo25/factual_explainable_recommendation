You are a review analysis expert tasked with extracting atomic explanatory statements from user reviews for the Toys domain. Your goal is to identify factual, objective statements that explain why a reviewer liked or disliked a toy with respect to a fixed list of topics, while filtering out noise and purely subjective opinions without explanatory value.

IMPORTANT — use the fixed list of accepted topics below. For extraction, use the short name (lowercase, singular) exactly as provided.

ACCEPTED TOPICS (short name (long name): description)
- safety (Safety and Choking Risk): Mentions of hazards, small parts, sharp edges, toxic materials, battery-compartment security, or compliance with safety standards.
- age (Age Appropriateness and Skill Level): Suitability for the recommended age range and whether the toy's complexity matches the child's development or skill level.
- durability (Durability and Build Quality): Structural robustness under play, breakage, paint chipping, loose parts, and longevity.
- educational (Educational and Developmental Value): Learning or developmental benefits (motor skills, cognitive, STEM, problem solving, creativity).
- engagement (Play Value and Entertainment): How engaging the toy is, replayability, attention span it secures, imaginative or social play value.
- materials (Material Quality and Finish): Material type and tactile/finish quality (wood/plastic/fabric, texture, paint/finish condition, non-toxic claims).
- functionality (Functionality and Features): Whether moving parts, electronics, lights, sounds, batteries, or accessories work as intended.
- assembly (Assembly, Instructions, Packaging, Size and Completeness): Ease of setup, clarity of instructions, missing parts/tools, packaging condition on arrival, and physical dimensions vs expectations.
- battery (Power, Battery Life and Charging): Battery requirements, battery life/drain, charging behavior, and battery-compartment safety.
- price (Price and Value): Perceived cost-effectiveness relative to quality, durability, and comparable alternatives.

TASK REQUIREMENTS
1. Extract atomic explanatory statements: break the review into the smallest possible factual statements that explain product characteristics or user experience, using only factual/explanatory content.
2. Assign topic: for each statement, assign exactly one topic from the ACCEPTED TOPICS list using the short name.
3. Determine sentiment polarity: label each statement as "positive", "negative", or "neutral" with respect to the topic.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON array (only the JSON array, no surrounding text). Each item must be an object with keys:
- "statement": string — the atomic, factual explanatory statement (present tense, minimal and decomposed).
- "topic": string — one of the short names from the ACCEPTED TOPICS list.
- "sentiment": string — one of "positive", "negative", or "neutral".

RULES FOR ATOMIC STATEMENTS
- Factual and explanatory only: include information that explains product characteristics or behavior (e.g., "wheels detach under play", "piece is non-toxic"); exclude pure opinions without explanation (e.g., "my kid loves it", "it's amazing").
- Smallest possible unit: each statement must be atomic and cannot be further decomposed while remaining factual and explanatory.
- Relevant to product evaluation: exclude unrelated personal context unless it explains a topic (e.g., "works for my 3-year-old" can inform age/compatibility).
- No extraneous temporal details: omit timing that is irrelevant to the product property; allow minimal time references only when they explain behavior (e.g., "breaks after two uses" is allowed to explain durability).
- Use plain, natural language and present tense.

RULES FOR TOPIC ASSIGNMENT
- Use exactly one topic short name per statement (from the ACCEPTED TOPICS list).
- Use the most general matching topic (e.g., prefer "materials" for type/finish, "durability" for breakage, "safety" for choking hazards).
- Topic must be lower-case and singular (as in the short names list).
- If a fact plausibly maps to two topics, choose the topic that most directly describes the product characteristic itself.

RULES FOR SENTIMENT
- positive: the statement reports a desirable or good outcome for the topic.
- negative: the statement reports a problem, failure, or undesirable outcome for the topic.
- neutral: purely descriptive facts without clear positive/negative valence (e.g., "requires 3 AA batteries").

SPLITTING RULE
- If one sentence contains multiple explanatory facts about different topics, split them into separate atomic statements and label each with the appropriate topic.
- Do not include phrases that are pure opinion without explanation (e.g., "I hate it", "so cute").

ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Always choose topics from the fixed list above; never invent or substitute new topic names.
- When possible keep statements concise and in present tense (e.g., "has small detachable parts", not "it had a small part that detached").
- Use neutral wording for descriptive facts; reserve sentiment labels for clear positive/negative implications.

EXAMPLES
Example 1:
Review: "The plastic edges are sharp and a small piece detached, and the wheels break during play."
Output:
[
  {"statement": "has sharp plastic edges", "topic": "safety", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "has a small detachable part", "topic": "safety", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "wheels break during play", "topic": "durability", "sentiment": "negative"}
]

Example 2:
Review: "Easy to assemble, instructions are clear, and all parts were included. The lights and sounds work as advertised, but it requires AA batteries."
Output:
[
  {"statement": "is easy to assemble", "topic": "assembly", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "includes all required parts", "topic": "assembly", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "lights and sounds function properly", "topic": "functionality", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "requires AA batteries", "topic": "battery", "sentiment": "neutral"}
]

Example 3:
Review: "This wooden puzzle helps with fine motor skills and keeps kids engaged. The pieces are thick and non-toxic."
Output:
[
  {"statement": "supports development of fine motor skills", "topic": "educational", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "provides sustained engagement", "topic": "engagement", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "uses thick wooden pieces", "topic": "materials", "sentiment": "neutral"},
  {"statement": "is non-toxic", "topic": "safety", "sentiment": "positive"}
]

Please extract atomic explanatory statements following the format above. Return only the JSON array with no additional text or explanation.
