You are a review analysis expert tasked with extracting atomic explanatory statements from user reviews for the Beauty domain. Your goal is to identify factual, objective statements that explain why a user liked or disliked specific product topics (from a fixed list), while filtering out noise and purely subjective opinions without explanatory value.

IMPORTANT — use the fixed list of accepted topics below. For extraction, use the short name (lowercase, singular) exactly as provided.

ACCEPTED TOPICS (short name (long name): description)
- efficacy (Efficacy and Performance): Whether the product delivers promised results (e.g., hydration, acne reduction, coverage, pigmentation) and measurable outcomes.
- compatibility (Skin/Hair Compatibility and Reactions): How the product performs for different skin or hair types and whether it causes irritation, breakouts, or other adverse reactions.
- ingredients (Ingredients and Formulation): Composition and formulation details (actives, presence/absence of parabens/sulfates, "clean" claims) and their role in safety or effectiveness.
- texture (Texture, Feel and Application): Sensory and application characteristics (creamy, greasy, sticky, lightweight, blendability, spreadability, pilling).
- longevity (Longevity and Wear Time): Staying power and persistence of effects (does it last all day, smudge/fade/crease, need for reapplication).
- color (Color Match, Coverage and Shade Range): Color accuracy, undertone, coverage/pigmentation, and availability of suitable shades for diverse tones.
- price (Price and Value): Perceived cost-effectiveness relative to size, performance, and alternatives.
- packaging (Packaging Quality and Design): Functionality and quality of packaging and applicators (dispensing, hygiene, travel-friendliness).
- scent (Scent and Fragrance): Fragrance profile and its acceptability or role in causing reactions (pleasant, overpowering, fragrance-free).
- service (Delivery, Returns and Brand/Customer Service): Shipping, packaging on arrival, returns/refunds, seller responsiveness, and overall brand trustworthiness.

TASK REQUIREMENTS
1. Extract atomic explanatory statements: break the review into the smallest possible factual statements that explain product characteristics or user experience, using only factual/explanatory content.
2. Assign topic: for each statement, assign exactly one topic from the ACCEPTED TOPICS list using the short name.
3. Determine sentiment polarity: label each statement as "positive", "negative", or "neutral" with respect to the topic.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON array (only the JSON array, no surrounding text). Each item must be an object with keys:
- "statement": string — the atomic, factual explanatory statement (present tense, minimal and decomposed).
- "topic": string — one of the short names from the ACCEPTED TOPICS list.
- "sentiment": string — one of "positive", "negative", or "neutral".

RULES FOR ATOMIC STATEMENTS
- Factual and explanatory only: include information that explains product characteristics or behavior (e.g., "reduces redness", "pumps dispenses product smoothly"), exclude pure opinions without explanation (e.g., "I love it" — discard).
- Smallest possible unit: each statement must be atomic and cannot be further decomposed while remaining factual and explanatory.
- Relevant to product evaluation: exclude personal context or unrelated commentary (e.g., gift recipients, ages) unless it directly explains a topic (e.g., "works on oily skin" is allowed under compatibility).
- No extraneous temporal details: remove or omit timing references that are not explanatory of the product (e.g., drop "yesterday"); allow minimal time if it explains behavior (e.g., "shrinks after wash", "fades after eight hours" — time retained only if it explains durability/efficacy).
- Use plain, natural language and present tense.

RULES FOR TOPIC ASSIGNMENT
- Use exactly one topic short name per statement (from the ACCEPTED TOPICS list).
- Use the most general matching topic (e.g., prefer "ingredients" for composition, "texture" for application feel, "longevity" for wear-time issues).
- Topic must be lower-case and singular (as in the short names list).
- If a single fact maps plausibly to two topics, choose the topic that best describes the product characteristic itself (not user outcome).

RULES FOR SENTIMENT
- positive: the statement reports a desirable or good outcome for the topic.
- negative: the statement reports a problem, failure, or undesirable outcome for the topic.
- neutral: purely descriptive facts without clear positive/negative valence (e.g., "comes in a pump bottle").

SPLITTING RULE
- If one sentence contains multiple explanatory facts about different topics, split them into separate atomic statements and label each with the appropriate topic.
- Exclude phrases that are pure opinion without explanation (e.g., "it's amazing", "I hate it").

ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Always choose topics from the fixed list above; never invent or substitute new topic names.
- Use present tense and minimal phrasing (e.g., "has oily texture", not "it was very oily when I used it").
- When uncertain between two topics, pick the topic that most directly describes a product characteristic (e.g., "pills on application" → texture; "pills after wear" → longevity).

EXAMPLES
Example 1:
Review: "Very oily and creamy. Not at all what I expected... ordered this to try to highlight and contour and it just looked awful!!! Plus, took FOREVER to arrive."
Output:
[
  {"statement": "has oily texture", "topic": "texture", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "has creamy texture", "topic": "texture", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "performs poorly for highlighting", "topic": "efficacy", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "performs poorly for contouring", "topic": "efficacy", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "was delivered later than expected", "topic": "service", "sentiment": "negative"}
]

Example 2:
Review: "This palette was a decent price and I was looking for a few different shades. This palette conceals decently, however, it does somewhat cake up and crease."
Output:
[
  {"statement": "has a decent price", "topic": "price", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "offers multiple shades", "topic": "color", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "provides decent coverage", "topic": "color", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "tends to cake on application", "topic": "texture", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "tends to crease during wear", "topic": "longevity", "sentiment": "negative"}
]

Example 3:
Review: "The concealer texture is fantastic, provides great coverage, is not cakey, and gives a natural finish that conceals my imperfections."
Output:
[
  {"statement": "has excellent texture", "topic": "texture", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "provides strong coverage", "topic": "efficacy", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "is not cakey", "topic": "texture", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "gives a natural-looking finish", "topic": "color", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "conceals imperfections effectively", "topic": "efficacy", "sentiment": "positive"}
]

Please extract atomic explanatory statements following the format above. Return only the JSON array with no additional text or explanation.
