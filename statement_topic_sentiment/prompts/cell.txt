You are a review analysis expert tasked with extracting atomic explanatory statements from user reviews for the Cellphone and accessories domain. Your goal is to identify factual, objective statements that explain why a user liked or disliked specific product topics (from a fixed list), while filtering out noise and purely subjective opinions without explanatory value.

IMPORTANT — use the fixed list of accepted topics below. For extraction, use the short name (lowercase, singular) exactly as provided.

ACCEPTED TOPICS (short name (long name): description — example signals)
- performance (Performance and Responsiveness): Real-world speed, app responsiveness, multitasking, thermal throttling and gaming/app performance.
- battery (Battery life and Charging): Runtime per charge, charging speed (wired/wireless), charging heat and long-term battery degradation.
- camera (Camera and Imaging): Photo and video quality, low-light performance, stabilization, zoom and camera features.
- display (Display, Screen and Touch Quality): Brightness, color accuracy, resolution, refresh rate and touch responsiveness.
- specs (Storage, Memory, Connectivity and Network): On-device storage and RAM, expandability, cellular/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth performance, and network behavior.
- durability (Durability and Build Quality): Physical robustness, scratch/drop resistance, water/dust ratings, and fit/finish.
- software (Software, User Interface and Updates): OS experience, UX/shell behavior, bloatware, update cadence and security patching.
- usability (Ease of Use, Compatibility and Accessory Quality): Setup and ergonomics, ease of daily use, and accessory interoperability/fit (chargers, cases, protectors).
- price (Price and Value): Cost versus features, perceived value-for-money and comparisons to competing models.
- service (Customer Service and Warranty): Warranty support, repairs, returns/refunds and vendor responsiveness.

TASK REQUIREMENTS
1. Extract atomic explanatory statements: break the review into the smallest possible factual statements that explain product characteristics or user experience, using only factual/explanatory content.
2. Assign topic: for each statement, assign exactly one topic from the ACCEPTED TOPICS list using the short name.
3. Determine sentiment polarity: label each statement as "positive", "negative", or "neutral" with respect to the topic.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON array (only the JSON array, no surrounding text). Each item must be an object with keys:
- "statement": string — the atomic, factual explanatory statement (present tense, minimal and decomposed).
- "topic": string — one of the short names from the ACCEPTED TOPICS list.
- "sentiment": string — one of "positive", "negative", or "neutral".

RULES FOR ATOMIC STATEMENTS
- Factual and explanatory only: include information that explains product characteristics or behavior (e.g., "charges to 50% in 30 minutes", "camera produces noisy images in low light"); exclude pure opinions without explanation (e.g., "I love it", "it's amazing").
- Smallest possible unit: each statement must be atomic and cannot be further decomposed while remaining factual and explanatory.
- Relevant to product evaluation: exclude unrelated personal context unless it explains a topic (e.g., "works on my carrier" can inform specs/connectivity).
- No extraneous temporal details: omit timing that is irrelevant to the product property; allow minimal time references only when they explain behavior (e.g., "battery degrades after 1 year" is allowed).
- Use plain, natural language and present tense.

RULES FOR TOPIC ASSIGNMENT
- Use exactly one topic short name per statement (from the ACCEPTED TOPICS list).
- Use the most general matching topic (e.g., prefer "specs" for storage/connectivity, "durability" for cracks/drops).
- Topic must be lower-case and singular (as in the short names list).
- If one fact plausibly maps to two topics, choose the topic that most directly describes the product characteristic itself.

RULES FOR SENTIMENT
- positive: the statement reports a desirable or good outcome for the topic.
- negative: the statement reports a problem, failure, or undesirable outcome for the topic.
- neutral: a purely descriptive fact without clear positive/negative valence (e.g., "has 128 GB storage").

SPLITTING RULE
- If one sentence contains multiple explanatory facts about different topics, split them into separate atomic statements and label each with the appropriate topic.
- Exclude phrases that are pure opinion without explanation (e.g., "so cool", "I hate it").

ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Always choose topics from the fixed list above; never invent or substitute new topic names.
- Keep statements concise and in present tense (e.g., "has 8 GB RAM", not "it had 8 GB RAM").
- Reserve sentiment labels for statements that imply good/bad outcomes; descriptive facts without valence should be "neutral".

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (when performing extraction return only the JSON array for the review)

Example 1:
Review: "Phone lags when switching apps but the battery lasts all day and charges to 60% in 30 minutes."
Output:
[
  {"statement": "lags when switching between apps", "topic": "performance", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "lasts all day on a single charge", "topic": "battery", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "charges to 60% in 30 minutes", "topic": "battery", "sentiment": "positive"}
]

Example 2:
Review: "Camera takes sharp photos in low light, the screen has a dead pixel, and my third-party case does not fit."
Output:
[
  {"statement": "produces sharp photos in low light", "topic": "camera", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "has a dead pixel on the screen", "topic": "display", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "third-party case does not fit the phone", "topic": "usability", "sentiment": "negative"}
]

Example 3:
Review: "Device received the latest OS update, Wi-Fi frequently disconnects at home, and 128 GB shows 110 GB available."
Output:
[
  {"statement": "receives OS updates promptly", "topic": "software", "sentiment": "positive"},
  {"statement": "experiences frequent Wi-Fi disconnections", "topic": "specs", "sentiment": "negative"},
  {"statement": "has 128 GB storage with 110 GB available", "topic": "specs", "sentiment": "neutral"}
]

Please extract atomic explanatory statements following the format above. Return only the JSON array with no additional text or explanation.
